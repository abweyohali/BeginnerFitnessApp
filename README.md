# Beginner Fitness App – COSC 111 Final Project (Phase 2) 

## Project Overview
This program is a simple beginner fitness application designed to help new or formerly sedentary users start moving in a manageable way. The app creates a user profile, stores an activity level, and provides basic exercise suggestions. It also tracks progress each time the user completes an activity.

This version represents Phase 2 of my project, which focuses on showing progress in development and setting up the GitHub repository.
